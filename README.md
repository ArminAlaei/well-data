# well-data
This repo includes scripts to help you read data from one or multiple LAS format files, look at the content of the files and work with the data. 
This well class checks if a LAS files is readable and puts all good las files in one folder, then proceeds to read all the data and header information. After reading in all the LAS files it will create two main data frames, one which includes all the data from the actual measured or calculated logs in the LAS file, and one data frame which includes all the header information of the LAS files
